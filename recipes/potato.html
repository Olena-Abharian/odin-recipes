    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      These traditional potato pancakes are wonderful comfort food. Serve with
      applesauce and sour cream for a light dinner, or with roast chicken for a
      hearty winter meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      These potato pancakes are wonderfully crispy on the outside and tender on
      the inside.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 large potatoes</li>
      <li>1 yellow onion</li>
      <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>
      <li>1 cup vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to low, about 200 degrees F (95
        degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Finely grate potatoes and onion into a large bowl. Drain off any excess
        liquid.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix in egg, salt, and pepper. Add enough flour to make the mixture
        thick, about 2 to 4 tablespoons all together.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 1/4 inch oil in the bottom of a heavy skillet over medium-high
        heat. Drop two or three 1/4-cup mounds of batter into hot oil, and
        flatten with back of a spatula to make 1/2-inch-thick pancakes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fry, turning pancakes once, until golden brown. Transfer pancakes to a
        plate lined with a paper towel to drain. Keep warm in the oven until
        serving. Repeat until all potato mixture is used.
      </li>
      <li>Serve warm, enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
